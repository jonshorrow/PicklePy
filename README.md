# PicklePy
Learning Python through pickle references.

Getting Started:

Mac/Linux:
Vim (or other IDE/text editor of your choosing)
Python 3.8
Terminal (for mac i choose iTerm running zsh) 

To download vim and Python (if not installed already in your distro), use your respective package manager. Vim may seem intimidating at first but once you get plugins you like (I use Vundle to manage them) and your .vimrc set up, it is a very powerful and useful tool. My personal .vimrc can be found under my vimrc repository on my github.

Windows:
Atom (https://Atom.io)
Python 3.8 (https://python.org)
git (https://gitforwindows.org)
Microsoft Terminal (optional but nice to have) (Microsoft Store)

I chose Atom over other IDE and text editors becuase its one of the easiest to setup for beginners, isn't to bloated with junk, and has git integration which can be really nice for a beginner.

Steps:
1) Download and install all programs.
Note: When installing python, make sure at the beggining you click the "Add Python 3.8 to PATH". If you do not do this step, you will not be able to run python in the command prompt. I also disable path length limit at the end but this is not needed.
Note: When installing git, just use the default settings. (they ask you alot of things and you do not need to change any of them. If you would like to, then go ahead but for this tutorial, I'm not)
2) Open up Microsoft Terminal (or CMD if you don't have/want terminal)
3) Run "mkdir github". Terminal/CMD should open in C:\Users\<USERNAME>\ . This command creates a github folder there to hold all github repositorys you download.
4) Run "cd github". This will take you into the github folder which should be C:\Users\<USERNAME>\github.
5) Run "git clone https://github.com/jonshorrow/PicklePy.git:". This will copy this repository into your github folder so you can start on some tutorials.
