# PicklePy
Learning Python through pickle references.

Getting Started:

Mac/Linux:
Vim (or other IDE/text editor of your choosing)
Python 3.8
Terminal (for mac I choose iTerm running zsh)

To download vim and Python (if not installed already in your distro), use your respective package manager. Vim may seem intimidating at first but once you get plugins you like (I use Vundle to manage them) and your .vimrc set up, it is a very powerful and useful tool. My personal .vimrc can be found under my vimrc repository on my GitHub.

Steps:
1) Create a GitHub. (https://github.com)
2) Fork https://github.com/jonshorrow/PicklePy.git
2A) Visit the webpage while signed in.
2B) Hit the fork button in the top right corner.
3) Open terminal and go to where you want to save this repository.
4) Use package manager to install/update python and vim
5) Run "git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/PicklePy.git". This will copy this repository.

Windows:
Atom (https://Atom.io)
Python 3.8 (https://python.org)
git (https://gitforwindows.org)
Microsoft Terminal (optional but nice to have) (Microsoft Store)

I chose Atom over other IDE and text editors because its one of the easiest to setup for beginners, isn't to bloated with junk, and has git integration which can be really nice for a beginner.

Steps:
1) Create a GitHub. (https://github.com)
2) Fork https://github.com/jonshorrow/PicklePy.git
2A) Visit the webpage while signed in.
2B) Hit the fork button in the top right corner.
3) Download and install all programs.
Note: When installing python, make sure at the beginning you click the "Add Python 3.8 to PATH". If you do not do this step, you will not be able to run python in the command prompt. I also disable path length limit at the end but this is not needed.
Note: When installing git, just use the default settings. (they ask you a lot of things and you do not need to change any of them. If you would like to, then go ahead but for this tutorial, I'm not)
4) Open up Microsoft Terminal (or CMD if you don't have/want terminal)
5) Run "mkdir github". Terminal/CMD should open in C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\ . This command creates a github folder there to hold all GitHub repositories you download.
6) Run "cd github". This will take you into the github folder which should be C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\github.
7) Run "git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/PicklePy.git". This will copy this repository into your github folder so you can start on some tutorials.
8) Run "git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"". Make sure that your email is in quotation marks.
9) Run "git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"". Make sure your name is first and last name and that it ahs quotation marks around it.
10) Exit Terminal/CMD and open up Atom. If this is your first time loading it, it may take some time.
11) Close out of all windows in Atom. Move your mouse to the right hand side of the atom window and in the middle a small arrow should pop up, click that. This should open the Git/GitHub section of Atom.
11a) CTRL+SHIFT+8 will also take open this. You may also go to packages->GitHub->Toggle GitHub Tab to open as well.
12) Select GitHub and click the link to sign in. Once you sign in online, copy the activation code and paste it into the GitHub Tab.
13) Go to File->Open Folder and open C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\github\\PicklePy folder.

Congrats, You finally have git and atom set up for python in windows. This may seem like a lot but windows is not as developer friendly as Mac/Linux.

Now that you have everything setup, You can now proceed to section_1_The_Beginning
