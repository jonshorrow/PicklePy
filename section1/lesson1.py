"""
To start out, you are going to need to know what a function is.

A function is a task that the computer can do over and over again.

Lets see the print function.

"""

#Will print "Hello Pickle" in the command line.
print("Hello Pickle")

"""
In python, some functions are given to you. (You will learn more later)

To "Call a function" (to run it), you put the function name (in this case print) followed by parenthesis ().

Whats inside the parenthesis are called an input variable.

Some functions need none, some need 1, some can take in any amount of variables.
"""

"""
Let's print something. Be creative.
If you want, print a few things. I won't judge you.
"""

#Put it here below this comment




"""
After you type out your print statement, go to the command line, make sure you are in
the section1 folder (may need to cd into it), and run "python lesson1.py".
"""

"""
Things you should be able to answer after this lesson:
    What is a function?
    What does it mean to "Call a function"?
    What is an input variable?
    How many input variables can a function have?
